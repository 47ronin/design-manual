## Visual Style
TBD

## Tab Usage
### Use for items that
* Are limited in number (~10) - less for mobile
* Do not regularly change
* Can be described in a word or two

### Layout
* Do not stack
* Place tabs next to the content they control

## Tab Labels
* Clear, concise language
* Sentence case
* Avoid Multiline labels

## Tab Interaction
### Make sure
* One tab is always selected with its content visible
* Only one tab may be selected at a time
* Tabs always maintain the same order and location

### Avoid
* Moving the page when selecting tabs
* Mixing other actions, such as collapse/expand, into tabs

## Mobile
### Considerations
* Narrow screens support fewer tabs (~5)
* Tabs should be sized to be comfortable touch-targets

### Responsive strategies
* collapse tabs into a vertical menu
* change tabs to icons

## Accessibility
## Code Patterns
