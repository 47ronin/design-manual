This list identifies core principles and best practices for design. That said, every problem is different and sometimes you’ll need to stray from these principles. When you do, be prepared to defend those decisions with research

## Understand the problem before you try to solve it.
Don’t jump in and immediately start working on a solution. Instead, talk to users, subject-matter experts, and other stakeholders. Look for existing research in the area, investigate best practices, and survey the landscape of products trying to solve the same problem. If the problem space is very foreign to you, see if you can find some kind of training to take.

## The user is not like you.
Everybody is a product of their past experiences, current situation, and future goals. Be careful not to conflate your preferences with the preferences of a product’s users. Have empathy for what those users need to do, and how and when they will interact with your work.

## Test early, test often.
Start validating your work as soon as you have something to validate. If you have sketches, grab somebody in the hall and ask them about them. If you have a rough prototype, find a couple of users and ask them to complete a task or two. If you have an almost-finished product, do in-depth testing.

Testing needs to continue after a product launch as well. Analytics should be an integral part of any product, which means you have to figure out what the goals are in advance. And those analytics need to be used to make the product better over time.

## Aesthetics count.
The Shakers had a saying: “Don’t make something unless it is both necessary and useful; but if it is both necessary and useful, don’t hesitate to make it beautiful.”

A visually appealing interface will make a tool more pleasant to use, improving the user experience. It will also help to establish a sense of trust and credibility in the product.

Don’t mistake decoration for beauty, though. The aesthetics of a product should be appropriate to its uses, and in many cases that will entail a deep focus on the core interface or content.

## Sweat the small stuff.
Details are the difference between a plain design and a beautiful one; between a good solution and a great one; between a tolerable experience and a delightful one. Pay attention to these details, and your design will be more successful.

What kind of details? Here are a few:

* Understand typography and pay attention to the visual hierarchy of your design.
* Use curly quotes and other correct punctuation.
* Pay attention to whitespace and how a design hangs together. Use a grid.
* Use transitions between states instead of abruptly changing what appears on screen.

## Make interfaces simple, but not simplistic.
In general, if you can remove something from an interface, you should. Minimizing the number of choices on screen will reduce the cognitive load on the user, making her job easier. In general, limit distractions and stay out of the user’s way. Extend this beyond UI controls: remove unnecessary decoration and words as well.

But be careful not to go too far, making something simplistic. Some things have a natural complexity to them, and there is a balance to making something as easy as it can be without dumbing it down.

## Choose appropriate defaults.
Most users will not customize software, so carefully select the default settings. In cases where the software can know something about a specific user (because they’re logged in, for example), use that information to make the defaults better than the generic case.

## Avoid adding features.
Every feature you add to software will make it more complex, harder to use, and harder to maintain. Don’t add features unless research shows them to be necessary.

## Don’t let people get lost.
Make sure your designs convey to users where they are, where they’ve been, and where they’re going. Provide enough context to make this clear, even when the user entered via an unexpected route.

## Be consistent.
Use the same name to refer to things in multiple places. Make sure things that look the same behave the same way. If things are usually presented in a certain order, stick to that.

## Design defensively to prevent errors.
Do whatever you can to help the user avoid errors: if a specific format is required, tell them (better yet, format things that way with software). If fields of a form are required, say so. If a concept is unusual or complex, offer contextual help. Anticipate common errors and design to prevent them.

## Make actions reversible.
Whenever you can, give users the ability to undo and redo their actions. This is especially important with form submissions, but also applies to things as simple as making sure the browser’s back button works as expected.

## Provide feedback.
When a user initiates an action, provide feedback in case of network latency or other delays. Let her know that the software is working, and if something is taking a long time to complete, let her know why. If something goes wrong, tell her immediately.

Don’t be an elevator with a button that doesn’t light up when pressed.

## Be accessible.
Follow accessibility guidelines to make things both more accessible to people with disabilities and more usable for everybody. Whenever possible, don’t limit access to information to specific devices or browsers.

## Be efficient.
Download times, computation times, and speed of response are all parts of the user experience. Optimize these things whenever possible.

Also let your users be efficient. Eliminate unnecessary steps. Don’t ask for information you don’t need.

## Design for people, not devices.
Don’t design around the specific capabilities or limitations of a device or browser. Design to be useful to users, then figure out how to make it work with the technology.
