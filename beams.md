Beam patterns are a
graphic background
element that provide
grounding and visual
interest.

Using overlaid shapes with 9ยบ angles
and the full CFPB Green color palette,
the beam pattern provides a bold and
engaging graphic reference to the beam
concept in our logo.

## Stylistic Guidelines
### Base shapes
Beam patterns are created using
trapezoids and parallelograms that
feature the 9ยบ angle.

### Color
Beam patterns include all three CFPB
Green tones. Using transparency
increases the strength of the beam
metaphor. Transparency should be
achieved through opacity, not blending
modes like multiply / darken / etc.  

### Composition
Beam patterns are composed of
overlapping beams that frame areas
of white space used for titles, text, and
other graphic elements. Beams always
point horizontally, not vertically.

Ideal composition  
Solid green beam
bleeds off the top
of the layout. Beams
alternate direction
to create layered
beam shapes.

Layered beams
anchor to the bottom,
leaving plenty of
white space above
for type. This works
especially well for
horizontal layouts.

Poor composition  
Beams float in white
space, leaving little
room for content. No
transparency used.

All three beams
layer in the same
direction, weakening
the beam metaphor.
