The CFPB logo was
designed to symbolize
vigilance, transparency,
and a consumer focus.
Consumers are the foundation and
focus of our mission and our logo
reflects that. A soft beam of light
symbolizes our efforts to illuminate
the financial landscape and foster
transparency in the marketplace.

## Lockups

### Horizontal
The horizontal lockup is the primary
option and appears on our stationery
and website.

### Vertical
The vertical lockup is useful for square
frames or narrow columns.

### Isolated
The isolated logo is primarily used for
internal-facing communications. For
all external communications, the logo
needs to be in a lockup with “Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau” to ensure
clear communication.

### Small execution
The small execution lockup is used
when the logo needs to scale down to
less than 0.75” or 54 pixels at 72 dpi. The
small execution logo allows “Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau” to remain
legible.

## Variations

### Spanish logo
The Spanish logo should be used for
Spanish language materials, such as
websites and microsites, publications,
and signage.  

This is applicable for the horizontal,
vertical, and small execution lockups.

### One color logo
When the logo is being produced for
print formats conditions may not allow
for full color. For these rare cases, the
one-color logo may be used only in
black on a white background.
This is applicable for the horizontal,
vertical, isolated, and small execution
lockups.

## Stylistic Guidelines
### Clear space
There should always be ample space
around the logo to ensure maximum
impact and keep the mark from
looking cluttered.

Isolated logo clear space

### Web scale
The small execution logo should be used
to optimize legibility of the logotype
on desktop and mobile applications.
These are our benchmark sizes for web,
but variance may be used for specific
circumstances or constraints.

Desktop scale
Lockup: small execution
Height: 50px
Padding: 25px
!["Desktop web scale logo"](/design-manual/assets/img/logo/Logo9.png "Desktop web scale logo")

Mobile scale
Lockup: small execution
Height: 40px
Padding: 20px
!["Mobile web scale logo"](/design-manual/assets/img/logo/Logo10.png "Mobile web scale logo")

### Print scale
The horizontal or vertical lockup should
be used for most print applications.
These are our benchmark sizes for 8.5
x 11” documents, including reports,
brochures, powerpoints, and forms.
For large-format print pieces, such as
posters and banners, where the logo
is used with a height greater than 1”, it
should be used in increments of 1/2”.

8.5 x 11” documents
Lockup: horizontal
Height: 0.5”
Clear space: 0.25”
!["8.5 x 11” documents print scale horizontal logo"](/design-manual/assets/img/logo/Logo11.png "8.5 x 11” documents print scale horizontal logo")

8.5 x 11” documents
Lockup: vertical
Height: 0.77”
Clear space: 0.25”
!["8.5 x 11” documents print scale vertical logo"](/design-manual/assets/img/logo/Logo12.png "8.5 x 11” documents print scale vertical logo")

### Complex backgrounds
The logo should be shown on a white
background for optimal appearance.
When this is not possible, the logo must
be contained in a white rectangle equal
to the required clear space.

## Examples of misuse
1. Don’t remove the light beam. It is essential to the logo.
!["Logo with no beam"](/design-manual/assets/img/logo/Logo23.png "Logo with no beam")

2. Don’t stretch or condense. This weakens the brand.
!["Stretched logo"](/design-manual/assets/img/logo/Logo16.png "Stretched logo")
!["Condensed logo"](/design-manual/assets/img/logo/Logo24.png "Condensed logo")

3. Don’t apply a drop shadow.
!["Drop shadow logo"](/design-manual/assets/img/logo/Logo17.png "Drop shadow logo")

4. Don’t outline the logo or use other colors. This dilutes brand association.
!["Outlined logo"](/design-manual/assets/img/logo/Logo25.png "Outlined logo")
!["Blue logo"](/design-manual/assets/img/logo/Logo18.png "Blue logo")

5. Don’t rotate the symbol. This changes the connotation of the light.
!["Rotated logo"](/design-manual/assets/img/logo/Logo21.png "Rotated logo")
!["Rotated logo"](/design-manual/assets/img/logo/Logo22.png "Rotated logo")

6. Don’t place the logo directly on a colored background or photo without a white bounding box.

!["Photo box logo"](/design-manual/assets/img/logo/Logo19.png "Photo box logo")
