Illustrations are vector-based graphics
that support primary headers and text.
They function as the brand's top-level
illustration style with high detail and
clarity. Illustration is universally relatable
and sets a friendly tone when speaking
to consumers. The content of an
illustration should always be politically
and socially neutral.

## Stylistic guidelines

### Form
Illustrations should feature flat elements
and avoid showing things in threedimensions.
Elements should not be outlined.

Do not scale-up or collage minicons or
isocons for use in illustrations.

### Composition
Illustrations should be compositionally
balanced with related headers and
text. Reduce “floating” by bleeding
illustrations off the edges of the graphic.
Make use of layering and subtle, vectorbased
background patterns to help
ground the illustration.

### Color
Illustrations should use the full range
of primary and secondary colors, but
selectively use a maximum of 3-4 colors.
Differentiate components or faces of
objects using tints. Illustrations should
also make use of 100% white and black.

### Shading
Shading should be achieved using
subtle, solid tints, not gradients, textures,
or blurs. Shadows are created using a
darker tint of the background color, cast
from the top-right corner of an object at
a 45º angle.
