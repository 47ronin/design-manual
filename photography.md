Photography is an important tool that helps us relate to consumers, communicate empathy, and build trust. CFPB images should preserve aesthetic integrity: photographs  should never be stretched, free of special effects, and always in full color. Images should be relatable, natural, and shot in a real location. 

An edited selection of our latest editorial photography is available at flickr.com/photos/cfpbphotos.

## Stylistic guidelines
### Editorial
Editorial photographs capture the events and activities attended by CFPB staff. These photographs show consumers, our partners, and CFPB employees interacting.

### Treatment
Photos should have a clear focal point, proper lighting, and dynamic composition.

Photographs should not be collaged, staged, unrealistic,  or use still lifes to illustrate concepts. Image manipulation should be limited to adjusting levels, contrast, and natural color balance.
