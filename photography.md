title: "Photography"

Photography is an important tool that helps us relate to consumers, communicate empathy, and build trust. 

CFPB images should preserve aesthetic integrity: photographs should never be stretched, free of special effects, and always in full color. Images should be relatable, natural, and shot in a real location.

## Stylistic guidelines
### Form
Illustrations should feature flat elements
and avoid showing things in threedimensions.
Elements should not be outlined.

Do not scale-up or collage minicons or
isocons for use in illustrations.
### Composition
Illustrations should be compositionally
balanced with related headers and
text. Reduce “floating” by bleeding
illustrations off the edges of the graphic.
Make use of layering and subtle, vectorbased
background patterns to help
ground the illustration.
