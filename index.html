<h1>Welcome to the CFPB Design Manual</h1>
<p class="h3" style="font-family: 'AvenirNextLTW01-Regular', Arial, sans-serif">
    The CFPB strives to better serve consumers via our online presence and
    print materials by using plain language; relying on simple, user-friendly design;
    and providing easy access to information that
    can help consumers make informed decisions.
</p>
<p class="h3" style="font-family: 'AvenirNextLTW01-Regular', Arial, sans-serif">
    This Design Manual is an open-source resource for CFPB staff to produce effective
    and visually-consistent print and digital products that are easy for
    consumers to access, use, and understand.
    The Manual includes our design principles, guidelines for user experience,
    identity standards, and code snippets for common user interface elements.
    The Manual will continue to evolve as we learn what works best
    for the CFPB and the people we serve.

    Many style guides influenced the creation and organization of the Manual,
    including those from
    <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/styleguide/">Mozilla</a>,
    <a href="https://ux.mailchimp.com/patterns">MailChimp</a>,
    and the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/gel">BBC</a>.
    Our primary inspiration is the UK's
    <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual">Government Service Design Manual</a>.
    We hope ours can serve as a foundation for discussing and
    practicing user-centered design in government.
