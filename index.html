# Welcome to the CFPB Design Manual.
### The Design Manual is an open-source resource built to help employees and contractors produce effective and visually-consistent print and digital products. The Manual includes our design principles, guidelines for user experience, identity standards, and code snippets for common user interface elements. The Manual will continue to evolve as we learn what works best for the CFPB and the people we serve.
