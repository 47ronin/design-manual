<h1>Welcome to the CFPB Design Manual</h1>
<h3>The Design Manual is an open-source resource built to help employees and contractors produce effective and visually-consistent print and digital products. The Manual includes our design principles, guidelines for user experience, identity standards, and code snippets for common user interface elements. The Manual will continue to evolve as we learn what works best for the CFPB and the people we serve.</h3>

<h2>Help us make improvements</h2>

<p>We have designed the Manual to be open for the public, which allows you to help us make improvements. All content has been released as open source under the CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication, and weâ€™d love for other agencies, developers, or groups to adapt it for their own use.</p>

<h2>Other Resources</h2>

<p>Many style guides influenced the creation and organization of the Manual, including those from <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/styleguide/"target="_blank">Mozilla</a>, <a href="https://ux.mailchimp.com/patterns"target="_blank">MailChimp</a>, and the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/gel"target="_blank">BBC</a>. Our primary inspiration is the UK's <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual"target="_blank">Government Service Design Manual<a></a>. We hope ours can serve as a foundation for discussing and practicing user centered design in government.</p>
