## Principles
### A clear typographic hierarchy is critical to the effective communication of our brand.

Type should be light and well spaced to reinforce the idea that the CFPB is
open, modern, and approachable.
This system uses weight, scale, and capitalization to convey the
relative importance of each heading within a document.


## Typefaces

### Avenir Next

Avenir Next is the primary brand typeface and can be used across all formats
from print to digital.
Its round and geometric letterforms are approachable and modern.

Avenir is great for titling, pull-quotes and lists, and in some cases can be used
for lengthy body copy.
Italics are included in the brand typography but should only be used on
rare occasion, when necessary for grammatical accuracy.

### Georgia

Georgia is the secondary brand typeface and is designed for digital executions.
Its high x-height and round letterforms play nicely with Avenir Next.

Georgia is well suited for lengthy body copy.
Bold is useful for highlighting or titling within body copy.
Georgia should not be used for display type or large-scale typography.
The Italic weights work nicely at a medium scale for pull-quotes or
language with a human tone.


## Print hierarchy

This hierarchy should serve as a basis for 8.5 x 11” documents, but
appropriate scaling should be explored for content of larger or smaller dimensions.

## Web hierarchy

### Headers

Consistent scaling, weights, and capitalization are used to
create distinction between header levels.

Headers are used in three weights of Avenir Next — Demi Bold, Medium, and Regular.

### Body text

Georgia should be used for the majority of body copy on the web.

Avenir Next may be used for introductory or accent text.
For example, Avenir Next is well-suited for use in tables or captions.

## Typesetting guidelines for the web

### Alignment

Typography should be set flush left.
This provides the eye a constant starting point for each line,
making text easier to read.

### Spacing

(insert annotated image of header margins)

Spacing between typographic elements should be open enough to feel light,
but close enough to establish the proper relationships between elements.
When setting headers and body copy, the white space should be 15 px, 20 px, or 30 px.

### Line height

Ample space between lines of type contributes to an open feeling
and ensures readability.
When setting body copy, the leading should be 1.375 times the type size,
or 37.5% larger.

### Line length

Comfortable line length allows the reader's eyes to flow easily from
the end of one line to the beginning of the next.
For a single column of text, line length should be an average of 66 characters
per line, including spaces, but may range from 50 to 75 characters.


## Web type accessibility

### Text contrast

WCA (Web Content Accessibility) standards ensure that content is accessible
by everyone, regardless of any disability or user device.

To ensure text remains compliant with WCA standards,
use only these permitted color combinations.
These options fall within the range of foreground/background color contrast
permitted by the Section 508 guidelines.

#### For more information:

Refer to the Section 508 Standards Guide at: http://www.section508.gov

This color contrast tool is a useful resource for testing the compliance of any
color combination: http://snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html

### Fully accessible combinations

Accessible text and background color combinations are shown below:

### Partially accessible combinations

CFPB Black text and white text on gray and gray text on white are only accessible
for headers sizes above 24 px.

### Non-accessible combinations

Never set CFPB Green web type on white combinations, as they are not accessible.

### Undesirable combinations

Even though CFPB Green and CFPB Black are accessible for large scale type,
this color combination should never be used for web type.
