    <p class="lead-in">Photography is an important tool that helps us relate to consumers, communicate empathy, and build trust. CFPB images should preserve aesthetic integrity: photographs  should never be stretched, free of special effects, and always in full color. Images should be relatable, natural, and shot in a real location. </p>

    <p class="lead-in">An edited selection of our latest editorial photography is available at <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/cfpbphotos/">flickr.com/photos/cfpbphotos</a>.</p>

    <h3>Treatment</h3>

    <p>Photos should have a clear focal point, proper lighting, and dynamic composition.</p>

    <p>Photographs should not be collaged, staged, unrealistic,  or use still lifes to illustrate concepts. Image manipulation should be limited to adjusting levels, contrast, and natural color balance.</p>
