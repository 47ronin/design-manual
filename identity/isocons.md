Isocons are visually sophisticated graphics, with more detail than a flat icon. By using an isometric view and arrows, isocons are able to go beyond simply showing objects and can indicate important actions and transactions.

## Stylistic guidelines
### Basic color approach
The basic color approach for isocons
uses the primary brand colors. The
isocon has black strokes with white fill.
This approach should be used when
there are several isocons together on
a page.

Black and white over green field

### Scaling
Padding varies around each isocon,
but all are relatively scaled within a
bounding box. These scales represent
the maximum and minimum for web and
print applications.
