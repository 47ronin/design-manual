Beam patterns are a graphic background element that provide grounding and visual interest.
{: class="lead-in"}

Using overlaid shapes with 9&deg; angles and the full CFPB Green color palette, the beam pattern provides a bold and engaging graphic reference to the beam concept in our logo.

### Base shapes

</div>

<span class="content-25">
Beam patterns are created using
trapezoids and parallelograms that
feature the 9&deg; angle.

### Color
Beam patterns include all three CFPB
Green tones. Using transparency
increases the strength of the beam
metaphor. Transparency should be
achieved through opacity, not blending
modes like multiply / darken / etc.  

### Composition
Beam patterns are composed of
overlapping beams that frame areas
of white space used for titles, text, and
other graphic elements. Beams always
point horizontally, not vertically.

<span class="content-25">
Ideal composition  
Solid green beam
bleeds off the top
of the layout. Beams
alternate direction
to create layered
beam shapes.

<span class="content-25">
Layered beams
anchor to the bottom,
leaving plenty of
white space above
for type. This works
especially well for
horizontal layouts.

<span class="content-25">
Poor composition  
Beams float in white
space, leaving little
room for content. No
transparency used.

All three beams
layer in the same
direction, weakening
the beam metaphor.
