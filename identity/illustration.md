Illustrations are an important tool for introducing the subject matter of a page, event, or topic. Illustrations are vector-based graphics that support primary headers and text. They function as the brand's top-level illustration style with detail and clarity. Illustration is universally relatable and accessible to all audiences. The content of an illustration should always be politically and socially neutral.

## Consumer illustrations

### Viewpoint

<div class="content-33 content-first">

#### Front-facing

These illustrations should feature flat elements and avoid showing things in three dimensions. Elements should not appear to be outlined.

#### Top-facing

Top-facing illustrations are object-based. Illustrations should be arranged in a way that it appears the viewer is immersed in a real life scenario. These should include 4-6 objects and relative sizing to create a realistic and natural perspective. Shadows around objects can be used to create realism in top-facing perspective. If using top-facing perspective in a project, all illustrations should maintain that perspective for consistency.

### Composition
Illustrations should be compositionally
balanced with related headers and
text. Reduce “floating” by bleeding
illustrations off the edges of the graphic.
Make use of layering and subtle, vectorbased
background patterns to help
ground the illustration.

### Color
Illustrations should use the full range
of primary and secondary colors, but
selectively use a maximum of 3-4 colors.
Differentiate components or faces of
objects using tints. Illustrations should
also make use of 100% white and black.

### Shading
Shading should be achieved using
subtle, solid tints, not gradients, textures,
or blurs. Shadows are created using a
darker tint of the background color, cast
from the top-right corner of an object at
a 45º angle.
