These are the strategic underpinnings for the CFPB’s brand and experience. They should serve as the backbone for the user experience, at once inspiring and binding the design of the CFPB’s offerings.

## Public service, public trust

<div class="content-33 content-first">

#### Honest, transparent design that wins the public’s trust.

</div>

<div class="content-67 content-last">

We establish trust through clear, concise, and approachable design that is always consumer-driven. We demonstrate transparency through our user-friendly online experiences and tools and our dedication to open-source content. 

</div>

## Give the user control

<div class="content-33 content-first">

#### Design to empower users with information.

</div>

<div class="content-67 content-last">

The CFPB motivates consumers to take the control of their financial decision-making; our designs enable this process. Good design increases transparency and succinctly hands the user all the necessary information, giving consumers control of how they use it. To create an empowering product, designers must rely on introspection and research to discover what path users instinctively take and then cater to those instincts.

## Aesthetic integrity

<div class="content-33 content-first">
          
#### Align appearance with purpose. 

</div>

<div class="content-67 content-last">

Aesthetic integrity is not merely “attractiveness;” it implies the successful integration of design and function. Appearance should align with purpose. Using clear and intuitive design creates a trustworthy tone and a powerful platform for supporting the CFPB’s mission.

#### Maintain consistency and clarity.

</div>

<div class="content-67 content-last">

Maintaining consistency in design empowers users to seamlessly transfer their knowledge and skills from one product to another. Focusing on consistency helps uphold aesthetic integrity.

## Design with data
          
#### Honest, transparent design that wins the public’s trust.
          
Because the CFPB is a data-driven organization, quantitative measures of success should be integral
to the design process. With the world’s information doubling
          
every two years, consumers often experience information overload and develop shorter attention spans. Furthermore, our ability to interpret visual information is greater than that of the written word. Succinct and compelling visualization of data and information gives data a voice and helps us clarify otherwise indigestible numbers. 

## Inclusion and accessibility
          
#### Design for the widest possible demographic with bias toward clear articulation, plain language, and intuitive design.
          
Inclusion – It is easy to forget that the people most in need of the CFPB’s message are often the ones who are the most difficult to reach, whether
          
It is because they have no exposure to financial language or simply don’t have access to the Internet. For this reason, we set the bar for clarity very high and aim to reach those most in need.
          
Accessibility – We design to meet each consumer where he or she is. We are sensitive to experiential level, timing, and biases and aim to design experiences that are equally accessible to everyone, and equally empowering no matter what the user’s skill set or familiarity. Simple, clean designs are the most effective and wide-reaching.   
          
## Coherent end-to-end user experience
          
#### Unify parts of the user experience and transition seamlessly between them.
          
The best design guides the user’s experience from beginning-to-end and caters to his or her expectations. Navigation between sections should be intuitive and transitions should be seamless. Consistent quality and attention to detail are essential to maintain a cohesive user experience.
