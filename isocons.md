Isocons are visually sophisticated
graphics, with more detail than a flat
icon. By using an isometric view and
arrows, isocons are able to go beyond
simply showing objects and can indicate
important actions and transactions.

## Stylistic guidelines
### Basic color approach
The basic color approach for isocons
uses the primary brand colors. The
isocon has black strokes with white fill.
This approach should be used when
there are several isocons together on
a page.

### Scaling
Padding varies around each isocon,
but all are relatively scaled within a
bounding box. These scales represent
the maximum and minimum for web and
print applications.

## Asset library
This library comprises all currently
approved isocons and will continue to
expand when new assets are developed,
as needed.
