# Buttons
Buttons signal actions. They should be used sparingly; each additional button on a page reduces visual prominence of a call to action. Destructive actions should be reversible or alert the user to confirm the destructive action. 

In contrast, [links] should lead users to another page or further information, or indicate a secondary destructive action.

### Visual style
Standard buttons use Pacific Blue with a 4px rounded corner. Use Avenir Next, Medium at 14 px, sentence case, for button copy. Generous white space lends focus and makes buttons more actionable.

### Button types
Use primary buttons for actions that go to the next step. Use secondary buttons for actions that happen on the current page. Avoid using multiple primary buttons on a single page; there can be multiple secondary buttons per page.

Reserve warning and compound buttons for destructive and multiple actions, respectively.

### Button labels
Use verbs and an active voice. Language should be clear, succinct, and informative. Avoid technical terms such as “form reset” and “submit.” Limit the copy length to 22 characters.

### Button icons
Use icons consistently, or don’t use them at all. Each icon should be used exclusively for one action. Icons appear to the left of the button text. Buttons that have “forward” actions have icons to the right of the text, and those with “back” actions have icons to the left.
