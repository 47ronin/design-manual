## Principles
### The primary color palette for the CFPB is green and black, including mid-tones and tints, and thoughtful use of whitespace.

A minimal palette, clear hierarchy, good information design, and
ample whitespace will ensure a voice of authority and expertise in communication.

### Background colors

These colors are used primarily for background wells and fields.
When alternating between tones, be sure to use enough tones
providing enough contrast between adjacent wells.

### Secondary colors

These colors are used primarily as accent colors, and
should be used to add variety to page content and illustrations.
They should never overpower the core brand colors.
