Links should lead users to another page or further information. In contrast, [buttons](link) are used to signal actions. Users should be able to identify links without relying on color or styling alone.

### Visual style
Standard normal links use Pacific Blue with a 1px dotted bottom border. Links should adhere to all other typographic guidelines, including those for color and web accessibility.

### Link types
#### Body text and lists
Links that appear in body text or link lists are underlined. Links are underlined with the ```border-bottom``` property.

[example of standard link in a Georgia paragraph and list and Avenir Next text]

#### Headers and navigation
Links in headers or in navigation are not underlined.

[include example of link in hero graphic, or blog entry, and in nav]

### Emphasizing links
Use icons when a link needs extra emphasis. Use icons consistently, or don’t use them at all. Each icon should be used exclusively for one action. 

Icons appear to the left of the link text. The color and ```font-size``` of icons should be the same as the adjacent text, including state changes. Icons are never underlined.

#### Internal links
Carets (minicon glyph EE02) can emphasize CFPB webpages, such as in a navigational list. Do not use them in expandables, or for links to an external, non-CFPB webpage.

#### External links
Use the external link minicon (glyph E610) to emphasize a non-CFPB webpage. External links should open in a new window or tab.

#### Email links
Use the Email link minicon (glyph E302) to emphasize a ```mailto:``` link.

#### Attachments and direct downloads
Documents minicons can emphasize a link that contains a file or document.

#### Examples of misuse
Be careful not to signal an action with a link–use a button for that instead.
